## Library Management System
A Library Management System developed using Java provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing library operations. Leveraging Java’s object-oriented programming capabilities, the system enables seamless handling of various library functions such as cataloging books, managing user accounts, tracking borrowed and returned items, and generating reports. Java’s robust libraries and frameworks, such as JavaFX for the graphical user interface and JDBC for database connectivity, ensure a responsive and scalable application. The system typically features modules for book inventory management, user registration and authentication, and automated notifications for overdue items. By implementing these functionalities, the Library Management System enhances the organization and accessibility of library resources, streamlines administrative tasks, and improves the overall user experience.
